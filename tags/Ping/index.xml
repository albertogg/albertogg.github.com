      <description>When you deal with a really bad internet connection everyday, as I do, you probably diagnose the network more frequently than usual and after that you call your ISP and explain to a person (that may think you are crazy) how you are having packet loss in a hop that belongs to them. Yes, you have to do this as many times as you can, until you get someone at the other end of the phone call that understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening and sends someone to solve the issue, if possible.</description>
