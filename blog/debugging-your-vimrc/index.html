<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> this is a short guide on how to debug your <code>.vimrc</code> and hopefully it
will help you find what&rsquo;s making Vim slower or inconsistent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days ago I added a bunch of new settings to my <code>.vimrc</code> that made my
motion sluggish. This was happening in MacVim and in Vim and it was making me
mad because apart from being slow, Vim was using a lot of CPU and with large
files it was unbearable. After being fed up with this I hopped on IRC and joined
the <strong>#vim</strong> channel to ask knowledgeable people how can I debug my Vim
configuration. A kind user named <strong>watabou</strong> (I believe) first pointed me to
<a href="https://github.com/dahu/bisectly">Bisectly</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bisectly is a plugin-manager-agnostic fault-localisation tool for finding
which Vim plugin is causing you nose-bleeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I followed the documentation on the <code>README.md</code> file and did multiple runs of
Bisectly but found no apparent problems with the plugins I had installed&hellip; I
asked again in the IRC channel and the same user (watabou) told me to put
<code>:finish</code> in the middle of the configuration and explain a bit what to do.</p>
<p>Let me explain it briefly:</p>
<p><code>:finish</code> works just like a <code>git bisect</code> but in a manual way. e.g. It
deactivates the latter half or part of the <code>.vimrc</code> file to detect if the
problem is in the first half or the second half of that file. After <code>:finish</code> is
added to the middle or any part of the <code>.vimrc</code> file open Vim and test if the
problem vanished, if it doesn&rsquo;t we need to put the <code>:finish</code> instruction on the
first or second half of the half (the first 25% or the last 25% of it) depending
on where the problem was initially located. Keep doing this until the error
&ldquo;vanishes&rdquo; by deactivation. With that hint in mind the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; should be between
the last two sections bisected. Repeat this procedure between that section until
the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is completely localized, remove that setting or do whatever you want
and that&rsquo;s it&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>In my case this sluggishness was caused by two options options, <code>relativenumber</code>
and <code>cursorline</code>. This is probably because using super fast keyboard repeat and
repaint doesn&rsquo;t get along well. After removing those options Vim was super fast
again.</p>
<p>Hope this super short post helps you figure out how to debug your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
